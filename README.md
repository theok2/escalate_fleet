# ESCALATE Fleet Operation Optimization Data

This repository contains optimization data generated as part of the EU ESCALATE project deliverable D5.4, demonstrating fleet operation optimization for zero emission vehicles.

## Overview

The ESCALATE project developed an advanced fleet operation optimization tool that enables fleet operators to efficiently integrate zero emission vehicles into their operations. This tool uses innovative AI methodologies combined with high-detail simulation models to optimize the fleet operation for all vehicles (routing, charging strategy and hydrogen refueling strategy) while considering energetic constraints, charging requirements, and hydrogen refueling needs.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains input data and optimization results for two fictitious long haul fleet scenarios:

### Input Data
- **`jobs.json`** - Customer delivery orders with pickup/delivery locations, time windows, and cargo specifications
- **`locations.json`** - Infrastructure data including depot, charging stations, and hydrogen refueling stations
- **`vehicles_ICEV_fleet.json`** - Fleet composition for ICEV-only scenario (5 conventional diesel trucks)
- **`vehicles_mixed_fleet.json`** - Fleet composition for mixed scenario (1 ICEV, 2 Pilot 4 BEV, 2 Pilot 2 FCEV)

### Output Data
- **`optimized_ICEV_fleet_operation/solution.json`** - Optimized tours and operations for conventional fleet
- **`optimized_mixed_fleet_operation/solution.json`** - Optimized tours and operations for mixed zero-emission fleet

The fleet operation optimization model was given the same locations and jobs for two optimizations. One optimization was conducted for 5 long haul ICEV and one optimization was conducted where 4 vehicles were swapped with 2 Pilot 4 and 2 Pilot 2 of the project. In the mixed fleet scenario, a charging station and a hydrogen refueling station is placed at the depot. The optimization model optimizes the vehicles based on the given vehicles and also the tour for each vehicle. The model aims for the most efficient total cost of operation while fulfilling all jobs.

## Data Structure

### Jobs
Each job contains:
- Unique job ID
- Package mass and volume
- Service time requirements
- Origin and destination locations with time windows

### Locations
Infrastructure points including:
- **Depot**: Vehicle starting/ending location (Ulm, Germany)
- **Charging Stations**: High-power charging locations across Europe (400kW capacity)
- **Hydrogen Refueling Stations**: H2 refueling infrastructure

### Vehicles
Vehicle specifications include:
- **ICEV 40t**: Conventional diesel trucks
- **ESCALATE Pilot 4**: Battery electric vehicles (1,100 kWh capacity, 400kW charging)
- **ESCALATE Pilot 2**: Fuel cell electric vehicles (68kg H2 capacity, 30.5 kWh buffer battery)

### Solution Data
Optimization results contain:
- **Summary**: Total cost breakdown (TCO CAPEX, energy, wages, tolls, CO2, etc.)
- **Tours**: Detailed vehicle tours with:
  - Stop sequences and timing
  - Load management
  - Energy state tracking (fuel/battery/hydrogen)
  - Charging/refueling stops
  - Detailed time tracking:
    - **`step_resting_number`** - Number of en route rests between the stops at any rest area next to the road
    - **`step_resting_time`** - Total duration of en route rests between the stops at any rest area next to the road
    - **`step_nighting_number`** - Number of en route overnight rests between the stops at any rest area next to the road
    - **`step_nighting_time`** - Total duration of en route overnight rests between the stops at any rest area next to the road
    - **`delta_driving_time`** - Driving time between the stops
    - **`delta_waiting_time`** - Time the driver waits after arriving at the stop and being serviced
    - **`delta_serving_time`** - Time of being servied (loaded/unloaded) on site
    - **`delta_charging_time`** - Duration of the charging process on site
    - **`delta_hydrogen_refueling_time`** - Duration of the hydrogen refueilng process on site
    - **`delta_resting_time`** - Additional rest time of the driver on site
    

The model calculates the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for the time horizon of the optimization.

### Visualization
Visualtzation files are added for a better understanding of the data.
- **`fleet_operation_map.html`** - Top-down view of optimized tours of all vehicles on a map. For a clearer overview, the vehicle tours are not only visualized with the roads actually driven, but also with straight connected lines between the stops. The purpe dashed lines indicate the pickup and delivery locations of the jobs.
- **`vehicle_charts.html`** - Plots of energy (fuel, electric SoC, hydrogen SoC) and payloads (mass, volume) for all used vehicles along their trip. The vertical line at the end of eSoC and hSoC plots indicate charging and refueling at the depot, which can be done slow or fast before the next use of the vehicle. Since this duration is unknown, it's simplified and visualized as instant charged/refueled.

## Technical Implementation

The optimization tool integrates:
- **Route Planning**: Efficient sequencing of customer visits
- **Energy Management**: Accurate prediction of energy consumption and state of charge
- **Infrastructure Utilization**: Strategic placement of charging/refueling stops
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Driver working time and rest period requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) minimization
